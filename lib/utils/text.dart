      " The exploitation of environmental elements – air, soil and water – as natural resources is as old as the history of mankind. They wanted to tame them, but at the same time they were afraid of them, because e.g. windstorms, earthquakes and floods – as certain forms of environmental elements – had a devastating effect on them. Conquest required experience, experience became knowledge, and knowledge was passed on to the next generation.The nature of the material world was already preoccupying the man of antiquity, from which he drew his conclusions through observation. Archimedes created his law of buoyancy, Heraclitus‘ famous saying was also born in antiquity: “Pantha rhei – Everything flows. The only constant is change itself.” The initial seeds of atomic theory can already be found in the works of ancient Greek thinkers. First, they imagined four primordial elements (fire, water, earth and air), then Democritus spoke of several identical atoms (=indivisible in Greek).The primal elements also appear in astrology, which express the basic energies of our lives. Water flows, almost unstoppably, and this perfectly exemplifies people with a water sign – especially when it comes to their emotions.And in 2024, science is already there, as researchers have for the first time witnessed the formation of tiny water bubbles in real time, which they also captured on video.";

      'Artists have used their work to visualize the devastating impacts of climate change, serving as powerful catalysts for awareness and action. By depicting rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity, artists have brought these abstract concepts to life, making them tangible and relatable.';

      'Energy is a fundamental concept that permeates our lives and shapes our world. In the context of climate change, artists have played a crucial role in raising awareness, exploring the interconnectedness of energy flows, and envisioning a sustainable future. This essay will delve into the artistic interpretations of energy and climate change, focusing on visual representations, the exploration of energy flows, and depictions of renewable energy.';

      'Our planet Earth has been called the Blue Planet since the days of space travel, because the water covering almost 3/4 of its surface shines blue when seen from space. It is this water that sustains life on Earth. Because of its importance, ancient Greek philosophers considered it one of the four primordial elements. In Hindu culture, it is seen as a symbol of life and purity.Water has many facets in the life of mankind: it can be both friend and foe. Humanity uses water for many purposes. But it is also a destructive force, as we see in the natural disasters, floods and tsunamis that continue to occur regularly today.So man’s relationship with water is twofold: to use the opportunities it offers and to protect against the threats it poses. The technical tasks involved are mainly solved by civil and mechanical engineers using engineering tools and methods. These professionals work in close cooperation: buildings are needed to house mechanical equipment, and machinery is needed to operate water systems.';
