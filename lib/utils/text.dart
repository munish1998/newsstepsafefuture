      'Our planet Earth has been called the Blue Planet since the days of space travel, because the water covering almost 3/4 of its surface shines blue when seen from space. It is this water that sustains life on Earth. Because of its importance, ancient Greek philosophers considered it one of the four primordial elements. In Hindu culture, it is seen as a symbol of life and purity.Water has many facets in the life of mankind: it can be both friend and foe. Humanity uses water for many purposes. But it is also a destructive force, as we see in the natural disasters, floods and tsunamis that continue to occur regularly today.So man’s relationship with water is twofold: to use the opportunities it offers and to protect against the threats it poses. The technical tasks involved are mainly solved by civil and mechanical engineers using engineering tools and methods. These professionals work in close cooperation: buildings are needed to house mechanical equipment, and machinery is needed to operate water systems.';

The exploitation of the elements of the environment - air, soil and water -
as natural resources is as old as human history. They wanted to harness
them, but at the same time they feared them because of the
devastating effects of windstorms, earthquakes and floods, for example,
as certain forms of environmental elements. Conquest required
experience, experience became knowledge, and knowledge was
passed on to the next generation.

Even in ancient times, man was concerned with the nature of the
material world and drew his conclusions from observation. Aristotle
formulated his law of buoyancy, and Heraclitus famously said: "Pantha
rhei - Everything flows. The only constant is change itself." The first germs
of atomic theory can be found in the works of ancient Greek thinkers.
First four primordial elements (fire, water, earth and air) were imagined,
then Democritus spoke of several identical atoms (indivisible in Greek).
The archetypes also appear in astrology, which express the fundamental
energies of our lives. Water flows, flowing, almost unstoppable, and this
perfectly exemplifies the water sign - especially when it comes to their
emotions.

And in 2024, science is already at the point where, for the first time,
researchers have witnessed the formation of tiny water bubbles in real
time, captured on video. (https://youtu.be/w4NRThvgJJo)

The planet Mars has long been the focus of research. This planet is the
closest possible location for life outside Earth, and therefore the easiest to
explore, and it is the place where, as far as we know today, it is easy to
imagine the discovery of some simple life form (at the level of bacterial
development), extant today or long extinct. Therefore, environmental
elements are being investigated as possible abiotic factors for life.

We have known for a long time that Mars has ice caps, but this year
liquid water was found 10–20 kilometres deep on Mars by NASA's Mars In
Sight spacecraft.

Water is the first environmental element that we encounter as foetuses
and we come into the world with some experience of it. After birth, we
learn about its many other properties through experience.

As children enter nursery school, their knowledge is extended through
playful activities, but nursery education is also building into its curriculum
a systematic approach to knowledge, without which we would not
understand how our world works.

In the school years, additional knowledge is imparted according to the
age and intellectual level of the children, and there is also, in a good
case, a build-up and interdependence between subjects, because
without coherence we would not understand our world. The importance
of water as an environmental element is reflected in the fact that all
subjects deal with it at some level. In addition to the natural sciences, it is
also present in the arts, or in swimming lessons in physical education.

It is a regrettable fact that school education still does not place enough
emphasis on activity-based learning processes. Traditional education
tends to provide facts and figures that children have to learn
mechanically, bypassing reflection and the exploration of cause and
effect.

We should not forget Rousseau's famous phrase, "Back to nature!". How
can we teach science effectively without depriving children of the very
opportunity to experience nature? How can it be motivating without the
"aha" experience? Yes, I get the point!

As a chemistry biology teacher and engineering teacher at university,
we were taught that the structure of the teaching process should be:
doing the experiment → writing down the experience in the notebook →
explaining the phenomenon.

Unfortunately, the schools, due to lack of material and human resources,
prefer frontal, factual education to that provided at university. This is not
to say, of course, that there is no justification for this. The frontal method is
obviously also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge. But today's
generation Z and alpha demand gamification, animation and videos in
the teaching-learning process. And it is the teacher's responsibility to
apply/use these possibilities in the classroom.

Once the basic knowledge is acquired and building on the prior
knowledge and soft skills learnt in other subjects, it is very important to
include the project method in the process to acquire higher level
knowledge. This will definitely have a motivating effect, because
children learn about the world through activities, and they come to
understand phenomena by thinking together.

Today's education system in Hungary gives secondary school students
the opportunity to study science subjects of interest to them in higher
hours (optional). I believe that in today's fast-paced world, it would be
useful to offer children in primary schools the opportunity to study
science in extra lessons. Having taught in primary schools for a number of
years, I have seen that, unfortunately, not only were they not allowed to
study biology, chemistry, geography or physics in higher hours, but the
number of hours was also reduced.

Finally, I would like to share with colleagues some useful links which, in my
own experience, provide some excellent ideas for implementing an
experiential lesson or project:
